## üéâ Show Description

I picked to make my podcast about undecided students at the school.The Plan is to talk about each major and give a short summary and pros and cons. This would be good for students who are undecided and do not have an idea of what to do after college. I would like to interview somebody who has an understanding of what they want do after college and give an explanation on why they picked what they did. Another episode we can do is view each building and give tours of each class with an interview of an professor giving an inside look of the class. Many students come into college without an idea of a career they want and I feel like with these episodes it can help students out.

## üì¢ Call to Action

After a person listens to this episode what do you want them to do?

Write at least two sentences that explain the call to action for this episode.
I am undeicded and i feel like some students might need help finding an idea of what to major in.
